## Workflow Mode Guard

Use this skill only when the active local workflow mode is `speckit`.

Before proceeding:

- Run `./scripts/hooks/workflow-mode.sh status`.
- If the active mode is `superpowers`, stop and tell the user to switch with `make workflow-use mode=speckit` or continue with the Superpowers workflow instead.
- Do not mix `speckit-*` commands with Superpowers workflow skills in the same session or worktree.
