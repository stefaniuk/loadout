## Context 🧭

The TypeScript tech stack needs a fast, modern test runner with good TypeScript
support and CI integration.

## Decision ✅

### Assumptions 🧩

- Node.js 24.13.0 (LTS) is the baseline runtime.
- TypeScript 5.9 is the baseline language version.
- Unit tests must run quickly in CI and locally.

### Drivers 🎯

- TypeScript support and speed
- Good assertion and mocking support
- CI stability and coverage tooling
- Developer experience and readability
- Active maintenance

### Options 🔀

#### Option A: Vitest (Selected) ✅

Use [`Vitest`](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) for TypeScript-first
testing.

| Criteria           | Score/Notes                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| TypeScript support | ⭐⭐⭐ First-class and fast        |
| Performance        | ⭐⭐⭐ Fast with Vite engine       |
| Ecosystem support  | ⭐⭐⭐ Active and growing          |
| CI integration     | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage and reporters |
| Ease of use        | ⭐⭐⭐ Modern API                  |
| Effort             | S                                  |

#### Option B: Jest

Use [`Jest`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) for testing.

| Criteria           | Score/Notes                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| TypeScript support | ⭐⭐ Requires ts-jest or swc       |
| Performance        | ⭐⭐ Slower on larger suites       |
| Ecosystem support  | ⭐⭐⭐ Mature and stable           |
| CI integration     | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage and reporters |
| Ease of use        | ⭐⭐⭐ Familiar API                |
| Effort             | M                                  |

**Why not chosen**: Solid but slower and more setup for TypeScript.

#### Option C: Mocha + Chai

Use [`Mocha`](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) with
[`Chai`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).

| Criteria           | Score/Notes                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| TypeScript support | ⭐⭐ Needs ts-node or build step   |
| Performance        | ⭐⭐ Reasonable                    |
| Ecosystem support  | ⭐⭐ Mature but more manual setup  |
| CI integration     | ⭐⭐ Requires extra tooling        |
| Ease of use        | ⭐⭐ Flexible but more boilerplate |
| Effort             | M                                  |

**Why not chosen**: More manual setup than Vitest.

#### Option D: AVA

Use [`AVA`](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for concurrent tests.

| Criteria           | Score/Notes                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| TypeScript support | ⭐⭐ Good but needs config |
| Performance        | ⭐⭐⭐ Very fast           |
| Ecosystem support  | ⭐⭐ Smaller ecosystem     |
| CI integration     | ⭐⭐ Reasonable            |
| Ease of use        | ⭐⭐ Different API         |
| Effort             | M                          |

**Why not chosen**: Smaller ecosystem and different patterns than most teams
expect.

#### Option E: node test

Use the built-in [`node:test`](https://github.com/nodejs/node) runner.

| Criteria           | Score/Notes                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| TypeScript support | ⭐⭐ Requires transpile step    |
| Performance        | ⭐⭐⭐ Fast                     |
| Ecosystem support  | ⭐⭐ Growing, but fewer plugins |
| CI integration     | ⭐⭐ Basic support              |
| Ease of use        | ⭐⭐ Minimal API                |
| Effort             | M                               |

**Why not chosen**: Smaller ecosystem and fewer conveniences than Vitest.

### Outcome 🏁

Adopt `Vitest` as the default testing framework. This decision is reversible if
a better standard emerges.

### Rationale 🧠

Vitest is fast, TypeScript-friendly, and integrates well with modern build
tooling, giving the best developer experience for this repo.

### Property-based testing tooling 🔬

Property-based testing should complement Vitest with good TypeScript ergonomics,
reliable shrinking, and active maintenance.

| Tool                                                                   | Score/Notes                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check)                     | ⭐⭐⭐ Best overall fit for TypeScript and modern workflows; strong shrinking, good generators, and active maintenance. |
| [@fast-check/vitest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fast-check/vitest) | ⭐⭐⭐ Best Vitest integration companion; use alongside `fast-check`, not as a standalone engine.                       |
| [jsverify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify)                       | ⭐⭐ Proven QuickCheck style, but older release line and weaker modern momentum.                                        |
| [testcheck](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js)                  | ⭐⭐ Useful ideas, but legacy maintenance profile and older release cadence.                                            |
| [jscheck](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSCheck)                 | ⭐ Historical option; low practical fit for modern TypeScript + Vitest workflows.                                       |

**Recommended choice**: `fast-check` (with `@fast-check/vitest` as the default
Vitest companion).

## Consequences ⚖️

- TypeScript tests should use Vitest by default.
- Property-based tests should use `fast-check` with `Vitest`.
- Other test runners require explicit justification.

## Compliance 📏

- `pnpm vitest run` succeeds in CI.
